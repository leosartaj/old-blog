### Highlights:

* I opened [\#9639](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9639) bringing in the rest of the algorithm for computing
  Formal Power Series. There are still some [un-implemented](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9639#issue-94189385) features.
  I hope to complete them in this week.

* Few of my PR's got merged this week([\#9622](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9622), [\#9615](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9615)
  and [\#9599](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9599)). Thanks [@jcrist](https://github.com/jcrist), [@aktech](https://github.com/aktech)
  and [@pbrady](https://github.com/pbrady).

* Opened [\#9643](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9643) for adding the docs related to Fourier Series.

### Tasks:

* Polish [\#9572](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9572) and get it ready to be merged.

* Complete [\#9639](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9639).

* Get docs of Fourier Series merged.

That's it. See you all next week. Happy Coding!

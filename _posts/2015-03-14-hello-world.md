## Hello World.

So this is my first post. I wanted to take some time to outline my goals for this site. First and foremost I want to make this a place of reference. Not only for myself but for others as well. I know that I can't be the only one that runs across problems and has to work through them to find solutions. My hope is that someone has the same issues but better timing in that I have already had to deal with most of the pain. I would also like to understand how other people have solved similar issues and the oppertunity to refine my solutions. So this brings me to point one, **interactivity**. 

I am going to go back and update old posts, but I plan on never deleting my old text just striking it through. I think that this may help others to see where my bad assumtions and missteps were so that they may hopefully avoid them. This brings me to my second goal, **documentation**. 

I want to not only document technical details of different solutions that I come across but more importantly the rational and assumtion that let to the decisions. This is for two reasons. Firstly, so others may see my thought process and understand if the choices that I made are truely the correct one for their situation. Secondly, I would like my own rational and assumptions second guessed and sanity-checked. I cannot improve and continue to learn if I don't know that I am mistaken.

So, with that, Hello World!

So, the first week of the `coding` period is over and  I successfully wrote a bunch of lines this week.

### Week 1:

In my proposal I had planned to implement sequences and binary operations like addtion, multiplication in the first two weeks of the coding period.
I was able to complete the main [tasks](/GSoC-Fun-Begins/#tasks) in this week.

<!-- excerpt -->
I have made a [PR(#9435)](http://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9435) which is now under review by my mentors [Jim Crist](http://github.com/jcrist) and [Sean Vig](http://github.com/flacjacket).

### This Week:

* Polish the PR and get it merged.
* Start with the implementation of [series based classes](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2015-Application-Sartaj-Singh:-Improving-the-series-package-and-limits-in-SymPy#seriesdata-class)(`SeriesData`, `SeriesX`).
The implementation details would have to be discussed with my mentors.

That's about it. Will catch up by the end of week.

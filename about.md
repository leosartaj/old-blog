Hi,

I am a sophomore at [IIT BHU](http://iitbhu.ac.in).

I am addicted to

* **Programming** - Programming is my love. I usually write code in Python. Am also a strong supporter of open source software and contribute to the SymPy project. You can find all of my projects [here]({{ site.contact.github }}).

* **Tv Series** - When free I usually kill my time watching shows. My all time favourite is [Friends](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). :)   

I make friends easily. Drop me a mail at [singhsartaj94@gmail.com]({{ site.contact.mail }})
